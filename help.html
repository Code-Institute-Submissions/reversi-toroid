		<h2>About this game</h2>
		<p>This game is a slightly modified game of Reversi (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi"
				target="_blank">for history and details read this Wikipedia page</a>).</p>
		<p>You can play either “Classic Reversi” or “Reversi-on-Toroid”.</p>

		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<h3>“Classic” rules:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The BLACK player moves first. BLACK must click a square on the board, so that there exists at least one
				straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new BLACK square and another
				BLACK square, with one or more contiguous WHITE squares between them.
			</li>
			<li>
				After clicking the square, BLACK flips/captures (makes BLACK) all WHITE squares lying on a straight line
				between the new square and any old BLACK squares. Thus, a valid move is one where at least one square is
				reversed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now WHITE plays. WHITE clicks an empty (GREEN) square making it WHITE, causing BLACK squares to flip.
			</li>
			<li>
				Players take alternate turns. If one player cannot make a valid move, play passes back to the other
				player.
			</li>
			<li>
				The game ends when neither player can legally click any of the remaining squares.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>“Reversi-on-Toroid” rules:</h3>
		<p>All rules are the same as in “Classic” but the board is treated as a toroid:<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The rightmost vertical is considered the left neighbor of the rightmost vertical.</li>
					<li>The top horizontal is considered the bottom neighbor of the bottom horizontal.</li>
				</ul>
