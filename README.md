A personal portfolio site
https://pavzel.github.io/reversi-toroid/

1. Overview
This is a site with a game almost identical to the classic Reversi game ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi ).
A toroid is used as a board instead of the standard square:
    1) the rightmost and leftmost verticals are treated as neighbours,
    2) the top and bottom horizontals are treated as neighbours.

A simple version: human vs. human. To be used, e.g., as a board game on the same device during travel.
An advanced version: human vs. computer. To be used by 1 human player.
    Strength of AI can be chosen from 0 (random moves) up to 1 (maximized win after 1 move), 2 (maximized win after 2 moves) and, potentially, further.
A research version: computer vs. computer. To be be used for comparison of different AIs, and maybe for development of new AIs.
